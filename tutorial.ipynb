    "- corpus as input, word vectors as output\n",
    "- constructs vocabulary from data and learns a vector representation => features in NLP, word clustering, and more\n",
    "- from output, look at closest words or phrases (word2phrase) from user-specified word based on distance (cosine, etc.)\n",
    "- distances can be added/subtracted => correspond to actual word relationships (king - man + woman = queen, etc.)\n",
    "- two learning algorithms: continuous bag-of-words and continuous skip-gram\n",
    "- performance: look at accuracy, but mainly concerned about speed (algorithms, sub=sampling of frequent words, dimensionality, window size)\n",

    "- Continuous bag of words: continuous distributed representation of the context; order of words in history/future doesn't influence projection; predicts current word based on context\n",
    "- Continuous skip-gram model: maximize classification of a word based on another word in the same sentence; continuous projection layer and predict words within a certain range before and after input word; predicts surrounding words given the current word\n",
